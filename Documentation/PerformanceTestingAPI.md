# Performance Testing API

## Overview

The Performance Testing API provides comprehensive tools for measuring and analyzing application performance in iOS applications.

## Core Components

### PerformanceTestManager

The main manager class for performance testing operations.

```swift
public class PerformanceTestManager {
    public static let shared = PerformanceTestManager()
    
    private var memoryMonitor: MemoryMonitor?
    private var cpuMonitor: CPUMonitor?
    private var batteryMonitor: BatteryMonitor?
    private var networkMonitor: NetworkMonitor?
    
    public init()
}
```

## Key Features

- **Memory Testing**: Memory usage and leak detection
- **CPU Testing**: CPU performance and optimization
- **Battery Testing**: Battery usage and optimization
- **Network Testing**: Network performance analysis
- **Launch Time Testing**: App launch time optimization
- **Benchmark Testing**: Performance benchmarking tools

## Usage Examples

```swift
// Performance test manager
let performanceTestManager = PerformanceTestManager()

// Configure performance testing
let performanceConfig = PerformanceTestConfiguration()
performanceConfig.enableMemoryTesting = true
performanceConfig.enableCPUTesting = true
performanceConfig.enableBatteryTesting = true

// Setup performance testing
performanceTestManager.configure(performanceConfig)

// Run performance tests
performanceTestManager.runPerformanceTests { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let performanceResults):
        print("✅ Performance tests completed")
        print("Launch time: \(performanceResults.launchTime)ms")
        print("Memory usage: \(performanceResults.memoryUsage)MB")
        print("CPU usage: \(performanceResults.cpuUsage)%")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("❌ Performance testing failed: \(error)")
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Establish baseline performance metrics
2. Test on real devices, not just simulators
3. Monitor memory leaks during long-running tests
4. Test under various network conditions
5. Measure battery impact of background operations
6. Use consistent test data for reliable comparisons
7. Implement proper cleanup after performance tests
8. Generate detailed performance reports
9. Set appropriate performance thresholds
10. Monitor performance trends over time
