## Overview

The Reporting API provides comprehensive tools for generating detailed test reports and analytics in various formats.

## Core Components

### TestReporter

The main class for generating test reports and analytics.

```swift
public class TestReporter {
    public static let shared = TestReporter()
    
    public func generateReport(results: TestResults, format: ReportFormat) -> TestReport
    public func generateCoverageReport(coverage: CoverageData) -> CoverageReport
    public func generatePerformanceReport(metrics: PerformanceMetrics) -> PerformanceReport
    public func exportReport(_ report: TestReport, to path: String) -> Bool
}
```

## Key Features

- **Multiple Formats**: Generate reports in HTML, JSON, XML, PDF
- **Coverage Reports**: Detailed code coverage analysis
- **Performance Reports**: Performance metrics and trends
- **Custom Templates**: Customizable report templates
- **Export Options**: Export reports to various destinations
- **Analytics**: Advanced test analytics and insights

## Usage Examples

```swift
// Generate comprehensive test report
let reporter = TestReporter.shared
let report = reporter.generateReport(results: testResults, format: .HTML)

// Export report to file
let success = reporter.exportReport(report, to: "/path/to/reports/")

// Generate coverage report
let coverageReport = reporter.generateCoverageReport(coverage: coverageData)

// Generate performance report
let performanceReport = reporter.generatePerformanceReport(metrics: performanceMetrics)
```
